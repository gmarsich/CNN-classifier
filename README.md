# Project - CNN classifier (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition)

### Marsich Gaia [SM3500600]
In this repository all the files regarding the project for the course "Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition" are collected.

Folder `data`: stores the provided dataset. The two folders `train` and `test` that are inside collect the images respectively for the training phase and the testing phase. The label of an image is given by the folder in which it is contained
Folder `miscellaneous`: created with the idea to store some useful code to do some tests. It just contains `dim_images.ipynb`, used to determine the type of output of the layers in the network
Folder `side_code`: contains the files `CNN.py` and `train_test.py`, where I collected some methods that were useful to tackle the assignment
File `CVPR.ipynb`: main file. The development of the project is here. It exploits the files in the `side_code` folder and uses the datasets provided in `data`
