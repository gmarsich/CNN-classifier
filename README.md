# CNN classifier

### [Marsich Gaia](https://github.com/gmarsich)
Implementation of an image classifier based on convolutional neural networks:
* Folder `data`: stores the provided dataset. The two folders `train` and `test` that are inside collect the images respectively for the training phase and the testing phase. The label of an image is given by the folder in which it is contained

* Folder `miscellaneous`: created with the idea to store some useful code to do some tests. It just contains `dim_images.ipynb`, used to determine the type of output of the layers in the network

* Folder `side_code`: contains the files `CNN.py` and `train_test.py`, where I collected some methods that were useful to tackle the assignment

* File `CVPR.ipynb`: main file. The development of the project is here. It exploits the files in the `side_code` folder and uses the datasets provided in `data`

* File `Report_GaiaMarsich.pdf`: report on the project
